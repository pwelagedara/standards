This section outlines standards related to Secondary Responsibility Requests.  These standards are applicable to CDR data clusters that are designated to be provided by a Secondary Data Holder via a CDR request to a Data Holder.

These standards define the information security mechanisms by which a Data Holder will connect with a Secondary Data Holder to fulfil a valid CDR request and the endpoints that the Secondary Data Holder will expose to fulfil such a request.
