## Consent
Consent requirements will be communicated between the Data Recipient Software Product and Data Holder via the authorisation request object.  The primary mechanism for capturing consent will be scopes and claims under **[OIDC]**.

Other patterns for the establishment of consent may be considered in the future, including the incorporation of fine-grained consent for specific use cases.

## Scopes and Claims

### OIDC Scopes
In addition to CDR data scopes the following scopes MUST be supported:

- `openid`: As described as [section 3.1.2.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest) of **[OIDC]**, this scope MUST be present on each authentication request.
- `profile`: Data Holders MUST support the `profile` scope as described in [section 5.4](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims) of **[OIDC]**.  This scope MAY be present on an authentication request.

### Claims
The following [normal](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#NormalClaims) **[OIDC]** claims MUST be supported. This list includes, but is not limited to, **[OIDC]** [standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) :

- `sub`: [Pairwise Pseudonymous Identifier (PPID)](#identifiers) for the End-User at the Data Holder.
- `acr`: Authentication Context Class Reference.  MUST contain a valid [ordinal LoA value](#ordinal-loa).
- `auth_time`: Time when the End-User authentication occurred. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC `auth_time`. It MUST be returned by the Data Holder in the ID Token when the Data Recipient Software Product has requested it as an essential claim according to section 2 of the **[OIDC]** standard. It SHOULD NOT be returned via the UserInfo endpoint.
- `name`: End-User's full name in displayable form including all name parts.
- `given_name`: Given name(s) or first name(s) of the End-User.
- `family_name`: Surname(s) or last name(s) of the End-User.
- `updated_at`: Time the End-User's information was last updated. Its value is a JSON number representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z to the UTC `updated_at` time.

The following additional claims MUST be supported:

- `refresh_token_expires_at`: indicates the date-time at which the most recently provided refresh token will expire. Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value, as specified in section 2 of [section 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-2) **[JWT]**.  If no refresh token has been provided then a zero value should be returned.
- `sharing_expires_at`: indicates the date-time at which the current sharing arrangement will expire. Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value, as specified in [section 2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-32#section-2) of **[JWT]**.  If consent is not complete or a `sharing_duration` was not requested in the authorisation request object then a zero value should be returned.
