The Request Object is a signed and encoded JWT specified in [section 6.1](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RequestObject) of **[OIDC]**.  As per **[FAPI-RW]** [section 5.2.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#authorization-server), the `request` parameter MUST be present on requests to the **[OIDC]** Hybrid Authorisation End Point. The Request Object enables **[OIDC]** requests to be passed in a single and self-contained parameter.

Request Objects MUST be signed by Data Recipient Software Products as specified in [section 8.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2.html#jws-algorithm-considerations) of **[FAPI-RW]**.

Request Object references MUST be supported if the Data Holder supports Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR).

### Requesting Sharing Duration
To facilitate the specification of the duration for consent to share CDR data that is approved by the consumer, a mechanism for the Data Recipient Software Product to specify a sharing duration to the Data Holder is required.

To accomplish this, the Data Holder MUST support an additional claim in the authorisation request object named `sharing_duration`.  The `sharing_duration` claim MUST be handled as follows:

- The `sharing_duration` parameter is a number
- The value of the `sharing_duration` parameter will contain the requested duration for sharing, in seconds.
- If the `sharing_duration` value exceeds one year then a duration of one year will be assumed.
-	If the `sharing_duration` value is less than or equal to 24 hours, then one-time collection will be assumed, and a Refresh Token should be provided by the Data Holder
- If the `sharing_duration` value is zero or absent then once off access will be assumed and only an Access Token (without a Refresh Token) will be provided on successful authorisation.
-	If a Refresh Token is issued for one-time collection the Data Recipient Software Product must call the Data Holderâ€™s revocation endpoint after successful collection of the CDR data.
- If the `sharing_duration` value is negative then the authorisation should fail.

Note that the period of `one year` in the above statements should be interpreted as 365, 24 hour days (or 31,536,000 seconds).

The Data Recipient Software Product is able to obtain the expiration of sharing via the `sharing_expires_at` claim.

### Specifying an existing arrangement
Provided a Data Holder supports PAR, they MUST also support the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim provided in the Request Object sent to the [PAR End Point](#pushed-authorisation-end-point). The Data Recipient Software Product MAY provide the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim in the Request Object sent to the [PAR End Point](#pushed-authorisation-end-point).

If a Data Recipient Software Product provides the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim in the request object to the Data Holder's [PAR End Point](#pushed-authorisation-end-point), the Data Holder MUST revoke any existing tokens related to the arrangement once the new consent is successfully established and a new set of tokens has been provided to the Data Recipient Software Product.
