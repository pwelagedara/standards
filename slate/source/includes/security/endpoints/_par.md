Data Holders MUST support Pushed Authorisation Requests (PAR) via the pushed authorisation end point according to **[PAR]**.

Data Recipient Software Products MAY send authorisation requests using **[PAR]** if supported by the Data Holder. Request objects which contain the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim MUST only be sent using **[PAR]**. If a Data Holder does not support **[PAR]**, a Data Recipient Software Product SHOULD NOT provide the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim in the request object.

The Data Holder response provides the Data Recipient Software Product with a Request URI in the response. The Request URI is then passed to the Data Holderâ€™s Authorisation End Point to initiate an authorisation flow.

In addition:

* Request Object references SHALL NOT be supported in any mode of use other than **[PAR]**. If a Data Holder does not support **[PAR]**, it MUST NOT support Request Object references.
* The Request URI MUST expire between 10 seconds and 90 seconds
* Data Recipient Software Products MAY provide an existing ``cdr_arrangement_id`` claim in an authorisation request object to establish a new consent under an existing arrangement
* Data Holders MUST revoke existing refresh tokens and access tokens when a ``cdr_arrangement_id`` is provided in the Request Object but only after successful authorisation
* If the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` is not related to the consumer being authenticated it MUST be rejected
* If the ``cdr_arrangement_id`` is not recognised by to the Data Holder it MUST be rejected
